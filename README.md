# HofNinja 

A minimalist and functional application for Wim Hof breathing sessions, created by a practitioner with 5 years of experience.

Hof Ninja is a completely free alternative to expensive apps, designed to be simple and distraction-free so you can focus on your breath, not on the interface. The app is built on real user needs gathered from years of practice.

Customize your breathing sessions with adjustable rounds from 1 to 40, breath counts from 5 to 150 per round, and breathing speed settings that work reliably across different devices. Set your preparation time and rest periods between rounds from 5 to 30 seconds in 5-second increments.

Enhance your practice with optional features including ocean wave sounds for a calming atmosphere, vibration alerts at each stage to keep you on track, and guided audio breathing cues. The app includes a beginner-friendly tutorial explaining the Wim Hof method for those new to the technique.

Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced practitioner, Hof Ninja provides everything you need for effective breathing sessions without unnecessary complexity. No subscriptions, no ads, just pure focus on your practice.

Start your journey to better health, increased energy, and mental clarity through the power of conscious breathing.
